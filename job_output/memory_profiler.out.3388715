'repr' is field-specific metadata, and can only be attached to a model field using `Annotated` metadata or by assignment. This may have happened because an `Annotated` type alias using the `type` statement was used, or if the `Field()` function was attached to a single member of a union type.

Our suggested max number of worker in current system is 1, which is smaller than what this DataLoader is going to create. Please be aware that excessive worker creation might get DataLoader running slow or even freeze, lower the worker number to avoid potential slowness/freeze if necessary.

The fast path is not available because one of `(selective_state_update, selective_scan_fn, causal_conv1d_fn, causal_conv1d_update, mamba_inner_fn)` is None. Falling back to the sequential implementation of Mamba, as use_mambapy is set to False. To install follow https://github.com/state-spaces/mamba/#installation for mamba-ssm and install the kernels library using `pip install kernels` or https://github.com/Dao-AILab/causal-conv1d for causal-conv1d. For the mamba.py backend, follow https://github.com/alxndrTL/mamba.py.
